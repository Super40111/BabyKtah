<p>-You start as a red ball in the top left corner of the arena. You must avoid the other balls except for the teleporter, which is in the center, as well as avoid touching the walls. There is another red ball which looks and moves like you, but you must avoid it. There is a lightblue ball that moves quickly towards you. There is a purple ball which is very slow, but will deplete your health very quickly. Lastly, there is a green ball which is a mix between the lightblue and purple balls.</p>
<p>-Anything that touches the teleporter will be teleported to a random area around the teleporter. If you are the one teleported, then you will score a point and heal some health. You die if you run out of health while touching an enemy; you cannot die from damage taken from walls.</p>
<p>-You may left-click on your mouse to briefly distract nearby enemies with a scarecrow. Using the scarecrow will place it on a cooldown</p>
<p>-The game tracks how long you survived and how many times you touched a teleporter. Go for high scores.</p>
<p>-Good Luck!!!</p>
